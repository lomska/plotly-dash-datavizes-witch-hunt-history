## About

This dashboard visualizes the data on witch trials and executions in Europe between 1300 and 1850. It was collected by T. Leeson and Jacob W. Russ for their economic research and can be found on Russâ€™s [GitHub](https://github.com/JakeRuss/witch-trials/tree/master/data). 

The researchers' idea was to prove the correlation between the scale of competition between the Catholic and Protestant churches and the surge in witch trials in 1550â€“1700. Hereâ€™s their [paper](https://www.peterleeson.com/Witch_Trials.pdf), and hereâ€™s a nice [article](https://qz.com/1183992/why-europe-was-overrun-by-witch-hunts-in-early-modern-history) on the subject. My initial idea was to put the trials on an interactive map. But once started, the creation process went a bit out of control ðŸ˜Š 

I had to remap the trials according to European NUTS levels to be able to use Eurostat GeoJSON data. The data preparation code can be found [here](https://github.com/lomska/plotly-dash-datavizes-witch-hunt-history/blob/main/app_data_prep.py).
